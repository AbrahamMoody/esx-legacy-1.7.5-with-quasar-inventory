Greetings,

welcome to my little Little Pony world.
This is an ESX server - state: 08.07.2022 on which all files were processed that are necessary for the use of Quasar Inventory.

Just copy the data 1:1 to the server.
- Edit if necessary the Start_Server batch file.
- Edit the Server.cfg with your data.
- In the folder \resources\[inventory]\ you add the inventory of Quasar!

Have fun :)
